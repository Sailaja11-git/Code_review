Review the following Python code:

```python
{code}
Please follow this strict format in your response:
1. Syntax Check:
If there are any syntax or structural errors, list them clearly.

Then, assume you fixed them and continue reviewing.

2. Bugs or Issues:
Point out logical mistakes, incorrect operations, exception handling issues.

Mention if function or variable names don’t match their purpose.

Note misleading comments or documentation.

Detect any potential runtime errors.

3. Improvements:
Suggest improvements for readability, maintainability, and performance.

Include missing or unclear docstrings and type hints.

Suggest better naming and any required refactoring.

4. Improved Code:
Provide the fully corrected version of the code.

Include complete docstrings for each function.

Ensure code is ready for production.

5. Explanation:
Explain how the improved code works.

Highlight how it resolves the issues found earlier.

6. Unit Tests:
Provide at least 5 test cases using Python unittest or assert statements.

Test normal input, edge cases, exceptions, and floating-point inputs.

Ensure coverage of logic and error handling.

Please follow this structure strictly and don’t skip any section, even if code is valid. Always explain the reasoning behind your fixes.
